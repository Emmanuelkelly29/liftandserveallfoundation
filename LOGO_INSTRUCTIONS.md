<!-- Logo Placeholder Instructions -->
<!-- 
To add your logo to the website:

1. Save your logo image as "logo.png" in the same folder as the HTML files
2. Make sure the logo has a transparent background (PNG format recommended)
3. The logo should be optimized for web use (not too large file size)
4. Recommended dimensions: 200x200 pixels or similar square aspect ratio

The logo will automatically appear in:
- Navigation bar (top left)
- Footer (bottom left)
- All pages will use the same logo

If you need to change the logo file name or location, update the "src" attribute in:
- All HTML files: <img src="logo.png" alt="Lift and Serve All Foundation Logo" class="logo-img">
- Footer: <img src="logo.png" alt="Lift and Serve All Foundation Logo" class="footer-logo-img">

The CSS will automatically:
- Make the logo white on dark backgrounds (navigation, footer)
- Scale it appropriately for different screen sizes
- Maintain aspect ratio
